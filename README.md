## Description:
This repository contains micropython code required to operate the MFE believer UAV with the hardware specified below. Code handling hardware components is stored within the hardware directory, whilst any advanced software features (such as an autopilot) will be stored in the software directory.

## Usage:
The project must be cloned directly onto the specificed microcontroller to function correctly.

## Main Hardware:
* SparkFun Thing Plus - RP2350
* 2x Hobbywing X-Rotor Pro 50A ESC
* 4x Emax ES3504 Servos
* Emax ES08MD-II Servo
* SpeedyBee Nano ELRS Transceiver
* Holybro PM02 V3 Power Module

## Other Hardware:
* TBD
